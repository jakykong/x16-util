Personal library of routines created or borrowed by Jack Mudge (https://www.github.com/jakykong)
Written for the Commander X16.

Any code I have written for this project is released to the public domain.
Code copied from other sources will be marked accordingly.

As of writing (early 2024), I'm still a novice with this platform and assembly in general. Please read this code with a very large grain of salt. I make no guarantees I haven't massively flubbed something. ;) 

Usage:

.import "util.asm" ; Imports all other library code

Or refer to util.asm for dependencies and import only what you actually need.

Other stuff:

template.asm contains a minimal buildable PRG file that can be run from BASIC using this library.
